- [ ] Trim control and data packets
- [X] Simulated packet-loss
- [ ] Simulated latency
- [ ] Simulated jitter
- [ ] Client disconnect (remove sessions, generate event)
- [ ] Client disconnect/reconnect (bad network conditions)
- [ ] Performance testing high-volume of single packets
- [ ] Performance testing, high-volume of large messages
